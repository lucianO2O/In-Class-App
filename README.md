## About Me
My name is **Luciano Elish**. I am a **Junior** majoring in Computer Science at SUNY New Paltz. I have always loved video games and played them all the time as a kid up until now. I only played on my console until my final year of high school, when I built my own tower PC with the help of a friend. From that point on, my interest in computers kept growing, and when it came time to applying for college, I decided to choose Computer Science as my major with no coding background at all. Since that point, I have loved coding and learning more about the Computer Science world.  
#### I have taken many classes at New Paltz, including:
* CS1-3
* Assembly Language and Architecture
* Operating Systems
* Principles of Programing Languages
* Discrete Mathematics + Discrete and Continuous Algorithms
* Calc 1 + 2
* Machine Learning
* Web and Database Programming  
As well as my current classes, being Web Server Programming, Software Engineering, Digital Logic, and Cybersecurity.
 
I have completed a few projects in my classes, my most recent one being a Machine Learning classification problem in my Machine Learning class that I took the previous semester. I chose to do mine on a large Steam game dataset. It had over 90,000 entries and over 40 features, and the task involved me creating a target variable to predict whether a game will be liked by the Steam community. I did extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as utilizing 3 ML algorithms for my predictions (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Linear Support Vector Machine). This was all done using Python.

I have also completed a project for Web and Database Programming, where I created a mock website for a Spotify-like music application that included a login page, a registration page, and an item page (for posts). The front-end was rudimentary; the point of the project was to understand how front-end AND back-end works, and so we worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as database work (MySQL) with queries, GitHub basics, and Git basics.

From this class, I expect to be using everything I learn about front-end and back-end to help me take on my own personal projects and help collaborative projects I am working on this semester with a couple of professors. I am excited to learn more in depth about GitHub, Git, Json, XML, YAML, Markdown, and the other interesting topics we will cover, especially the frameworks Vue and Bulma. I am excited to be able to work on mobile apps and hopefully will be able to make apps for myself and others to use.
